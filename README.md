# WineQuality

Proyect done for the Mathematics in Machine Learning Class in Politecnico di Torino - Data Science and Engineering MsC.

## Objective

This proyect deals with Vihno Verde produced in Portugal and there are severe physicochemical characteristics in the dataset taken from [ML repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). Each of the wines have been given a score by a professional sommelier from 0 to 10 depending on the quality.
